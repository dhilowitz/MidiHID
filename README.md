**MidiHID transforms USB devices into powerful MIDI controllers on Mac OS X Leopard and later.**

Use it to connect any USB HID compatible device (keyboard, joysticks, game controllers... even Guitar Hero ones), to any MIDI compatible software running on your Mac.

MidiHID is fully extensible thanks to configuration files that describe how to translate USB events to MIDI messages for a given device. Configuration files are written using the fast and lightweight Lua scripting language, which ensures minimal processor usage and latency during your performance.

More detailed information is available from the archived version of the former [http://www.polhosting.info/web-archives/midihid/ midihid.com website].

*MidiHID also implements OSC support but this is not exposed through the user interface at the time.*
